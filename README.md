xComfort gateway
================

This code implements communication with the Eaton xComfort CKOZ-00/14
Communication stick (CI stick).  The CI stick needs to be added into
the network with CKOZ-00/13.

xComfort is a wireless European home automation system, using the
868,3MHz band.  The system is regrettably closed source.  This code
was reverse engineered from a variety of sources, plus some initial
inspiration from <https://github.com/mifi/libxcomfort>.

This code has been tested with and recognizes at least the following
messages:

 * MSG_ON
 * MSG_OFF
 * MSG_UP_PRESSED
 * MSG_UP_RELEASED
 * MSG_DOWN_PRESSED
 * MSG_DOWN_RELEASED
 * MSG_STATUS

Furthermore, it can send on/off/dim% messages to devices.  Messages
for controlling eg. shutters is outlined, but untested.

xComfort status messages are not routed and have no delivery
guarantees.  When status messages are lost, lights may for instance be
switched on and off, and you will never know.  Careful placement of
the USB stick is important, so that it can see these messages,
however, in my case, some messages are still lost.  Polling devices in
a round robin fashion might provide a somewhat clumsy workaround for
this, but that's presently not implemented.  Newer xComfort devices
support "extended status messages" that are routed, but I have no such
devices and don't know if they work with this software.

The code has been written without any kind of documentation from
Eaton, and may not follow their specifications.

The CKOZ-00/14 doesn't expose or know which devices hide behind the
datapoints.  It's the user's responsibility to send correct messages
to the datapoints; this code does no validation of messages sent.
However, the devices appear to ignore messages they don't understand.
MRF can export a datapoint to device map, but I have not added support
for that, as the benefits were limited.

A simple application for forwarding events to and from an MQTT server is
provided.  This can be used eg. to interface an xComfort installation with
[homebridge-mqttswitch](https://github.com/ilcato/homebridge-mqttswitch)
or [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/), with a little imagination.
The application subscribes to the topics:

    "xcomfort/+/set/dimmer" (accepts values from 0-100)
    "xcomfort/+/set/switch" (accepts true or false)

and publishes on the topics:

    "xcomfort/[datapoint number]/get/dimmer" (value from 0-100)
    "xcomfort/[datapoint number]/get/switch" (true or false)

Sending `true` to topic `xcomfort/1/set/switch` will send a message to
datapoint 1 to turn on.  This will work for both switches and dimmers.
Sending the value `50` to `xcomfort/1/set/dimmer` will send a message to
datapoint 1 to set 50% dimming.  This will work only for dimmers.

Likewise, `xcomfort/1/get/dimmer` and `xcomfort/1/get/switch`
will be set to the value reported by the dimmer/switch, if and when 
datapoint 1 reports changes.  Status reports are not routed in the xComfort
network, so if your CI stick is not able to reach all devices, these status
messages will be lost.

_WARNING: The firmware "RF V2.08 - USB V2.05" is buggy and will read
status reports from dimmers incorrectly as always off.  This is
resolved in the later "RF V2.10 - USB V2.05" firmware._
